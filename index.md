I recently earned my Ph.D. from the University of Southern California. I was advised by [Prof. Greg Ver Steeg](https://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about). I am interested in unsupervised learning, representation learning, and using machine learning for scientific advancement and improving and scaling decision-making capabilities. More recently, I have been working on fairness 
  ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04108),
  [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12574),
  [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03952)) 
  and privacy
  ([4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02866),
  [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05249), 
  [6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19264))
  problems in machine learning and federated learning
  ([7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12430)).
  This culminated in a Ph.D. thesis titled "[Controlling Information in Neural Networks for Fairness and Privacy](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8bpuc5gfm6vobm952n7ng/thesis_umang.pdf?dl=0&rlkey=fg2trm9t3h1jn22gkcd8razjf)." 

During my Ph.D., I spent a summer at Amazon-Alexa AI as an applied scientist intern mentored by [Aram Galstyan](https://www.amazon.science/author/aram-galstyan), [Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/), and [Rahul Gupta](https://www.amazon.science/author/rahul-gupta), working on [fairness in language models](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.55/). I spent another summer at Morgan Stanley, working on [time-series problems](https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2023/#papers).
 
Before coming to USC, I spent two years at Visa Inc., Bangalore, as a senior software developer, where I led the development of web applications for  card management. Before that, I spent five wonderful years at IIT Delhi, concluding with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering and a silver medal.

## Not Research
- I enjoy hacking together JS and HTML to create useful pages. [I once parsed conference proceedings to enable searching through them](https://umgupta.github.io/paperquest/).
- Basic Chrome add-ons to [hide YouTube recommendations](https://github.com/umgupta/hide-youtube-recommendation) and [enhance Grammarly editor](https://github.com/umgupta/grammarly-extend-editor). 
- You can often find [me](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3236925/umang-gupta) answering [PyTorch questions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:3236925%20[pytorch]%20is:answer).
