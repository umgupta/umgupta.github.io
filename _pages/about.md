I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California advised by [Prof. Greg Ver Steeg](https://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about). Broadly, I am interested in unsupervised learning, representation learning, and using machine learning for scientific advancement. More recently, I have been working on fairness

and privacy

<!-- I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California advised by [Prof. Greg Ver Steeg](https://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about). Broadly, I am interested in unsupervised learning, representation learning, and using machine learning for scientific advancement. Recently, I have been working on controlling information in activations and weights of the neural networks. -->

Before that, I worked on finding optimal strategies for Stackelberg security games with deep reinforcement learning and solving catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Before coming to USC, I spent two years at Visa Inc., Bangalore, employed as a Sr. software developer, and five wonderful years at IIT Delhi, concluding with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering.
