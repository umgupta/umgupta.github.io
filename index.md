## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Greg Ver Steeg](https://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about). I am interested in unsupervised learning, representation learning, and using machine learning for scientific advancement. More recently, I have been working on fairness
  ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04108),
  [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12574),
  [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03952))
and privacy
  ([4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02866),
  [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05249))
  problems in machine learning and federated learning
  ([6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12430)).

Before that, I worked on finding optimal strategies for Stackelberg security games with deep reinforcement learning and solving catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Before coming to USC, I spent two years at Visa Inc., Bangalore, employed as a senior software developer, and five wonderful years at IIT Delhi, concluding with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering.
