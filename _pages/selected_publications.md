<div class='paper_details'><div class="paper_authors"><b>Umang Gupta</b>, Aaron Ferber, Bistra Dilkina, Greg Ver Steeg</div>
<p class='note'>We propose a new representation learning algorithm to control parity of any decision algorithm. We theoretically establish that by limiting the mutual information between representations and protected attributes, we can assuredly limit the statistical parity of any classifier. We demonstrate an effective method for controlling fairness through mutual information based on contrastive information estimators and show that they outperform approaches that rely on variational bounds based on complex generative models.</p><ul>

<div class="paper_title">Improved Brain Age Estimation with Slice-based Set Networks</div>
<div class='paper_details'><div class="paper_authors"><b>Umang Gupta</b>, Pradeep K. Lam, Greg Ver Steeg, Paul M. Thompson</div>
<p class='note'>We propose a new architecture for BrainAGE prediction, which works by encoding a single 2D slice in an MRI with a deep 2D-CNN model and combining the information from these 2D-slice encodings by using set networks or permutation invariant lay- ers. Experiments on the BrainAGE prediction problem, using the UK Biobank dataset showed that the model with the permutation invariant layers trains faster and provides better predictions compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches.</p><ul>

<div class='paper_details'><div class="paper_authors">Nitin Kamra, <b>Umang Gupta</b>, Kai Wang, Fei Fang, Yan Liu, Milind Tambe</div>
<p class='note'>An approximate extension of fictitious play in continuous action spaces, DeepFP is proposed. DeepFP represents players’ approximate best responses with implicit density approximators and trains them with a model-based learning regime. We demonstrate stable convergence to Nash equilibrium on several classic games and in a forest security domain. DeepFP learns strategies robust to adversarial exploitation and scales well with players’ resources.</p><ul>

<div class='paper_details'><div class="paper_authors">Nitin Kamra, <b>Umang Gupta</b>, Yan Liu</div>
<p class='note'>Deriving inspiration from human complementary learning systems (hippocampus and neocortex), we develop a dual memory architecture capable of learning continuously from sequentially incoming tasks while averting catastrophic forgetting. We perform memory consolidation via generative replay of past experiences and demonstrate improved retention on task of learning from sequential non-iid examples.</p><ul>
